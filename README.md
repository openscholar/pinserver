## About

A Drupal module that servers as an interface between [Harvard University PIN system](http://www.pin.harvard.edu/)
and Drupal applications / websites. The purpose of this module is to encapsulate low level details of
PIN and provide and set of APIs for drupal developers.

The module was developed for and it's part of [OpenScholar](http://openscholar.harvard.edu)
distribution but does not depend on OpenScholar and can be used in any Drupal installation.

1. [Install the module](http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes)
2. [Register as a PIN2 customer](http://reference.pin.harvard.edu/dev-registration)
3. [Download and install GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html)
4. [Create a GPG key on your server](http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.1)
5. [Import the Harvard PIN public key](http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.3)
6. Send your public GPG key to directory_services@harvard.edu
7. Configure your GPG and Harvard PIN application info at /admin/settings/pinserver
